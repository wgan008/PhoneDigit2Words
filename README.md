# PhoneDigit2Words

The problem is:
Digits on a phone have a list of letters associated with them. For example, 2 can be 'A', 'B', or 'C'. Phone numbers can be expressed as letters, which makes them easier to remember. For instance, 2655328 maps to COLLECT. Write a function that takes a phone number as a string (e.g. "3278227") and prints words that can be made with the phone number. Find translations that are made up of one or more words which are at least 3 characters long.

Example:

Dict: ['FASTCAR', 'FAST','CAR', 'VISITED']
Input: "3278227" , Output: [['FAST','CAR'], ['FASTCAR']]
Input: "8474833" , Output: [['VISITED']]
